first, we declare the strength and the amount of dragons. then we input each individual dragons, strength and bonus. then the program sorts the array using insertion sort. then the program checks if the dragon can be defeated or not. if the strength is more than the dragon's strength, we add the player's strength with a bonus. if not, we break the loop and the program will print the "NO" output. if all dragons can be defeated by the player, then the program will print the "YES" output.

first, we declare the amount of secretary and also input each call session. then we sort the array using the selection sort. then we check the duplicate in the array. if there is a number has one duplicate, the valid call session counter will increase as well. if the amount of the duplicate is more than one, the program will exit the loop automatically and the program will print the "-1" output.
